## Introduction

The California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) aims to make transit simpler and more cost-effective for riders and transit providers. Cal-ITP has three high-level [goals](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/cal-itp-carb-market-sounding-final-020921-a11y.pdf): (1) streamline access to transit benefits and discounts; (2) support accurate and reliable transit data; and (3) reduce friction in the transit payment process. Cal-ITP advances these goals in part as a software collaborative by distributing tools and technical support services for transit providers.

As part of this work, Cal-ITP developed the [Benefits Application](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/), a web application that links to riders’ contactless credit or debit cards to automate eligibility verification for and enrollment in transit benefits. Cal-ITP's goal for the Benefits App is to offer a privacy-forward and more convenient alternative to in-person, paper-based verification processes, thus simplifying the benefits enrollment and verification process for both transit riders and transit agencies while asking for the minimum amount of personal data. 

Cal-ITP has also created a [Mobility Marketplace](https://www.camobilitymarketplace.org/about) which functions as a vehicle for transit agencies to participate in this collaborative. Acting as an online “catalog” for Cal-ITP’s available software, hardware, and technical support services, transit agencies can visit Mobility Marketplace to access technologies and technical assistance to simplify their transit planning and payments systems in a cost-effective way procured using the buying power of the State of California via State Purchasing Schedules.


## History

The Benefits App’s development was informed by an initial [Market Sounding event](https://dot.ca.gov/cal-itp) organized by Cal-ITP in October 2019, at which Cal-ITP gathered [public and private organizations](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/participating-entities-a11y.pdf) in the transit sector to [explore](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/cal-itp-market-sounding-event-presentation-final-a11y.pdf) the payment phase of a transit user’s journey. Specifically they explored how a “collaborative, state-supported, and statewide effort” might help simplify and remove friction from fare payment in California. 

The resulting [Market Sounding report](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/final-cal-itp-market-sounding-market-response-summary-103119b-a11y.pdf) summarizes the priorities Cal-ITP identified through the event which include: helping public transportation agencies implement payment standards with an emphasis on contactless payments to “enable statewide, seamless fare payments”, and leveraging California’s buying power in the transit sector to lower the cost of implementing new fare collection software and hardware for transit providers. Identifying these two priorities was an important prerequisite to establishing Cal-ITP as a software collaborative that could support transit providers with standardized and centrally-provided tools.

Soon after the 2019 Market Sounding, Cal-ITP’s main areas of focus emerged, as outlined in its 2020 [Feasibility Study](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/calitp-feasibility-study-042420-a11y.pdf%27): (1) ensure standardized statewide access to reliable transit information; (2) create a standardized statewide fare payment system; and (3) create a statewide eligibility verification program for riders with discounted fares. This study laid the groundwork for the Benefits App, outlining that existing in-person and/or paper-based processes for proving transit benefits eligibility are generally not compatible with digital fare systems. The study also made clear that adopting digital, contactless payment solutions could create new hurdles for low-income riders, seniors, children, and people with disabilities as they navigate the process of verifying their eligibility for transit benefits, and that a statewide eligibility verification program should work to mitigate these challenges. 

Following an initial pilot in late [2021](https://www.calitp.org/assets/Cal-ITP.2021.Accomplishments.Report.pdf), Cal-ITP [launched](https://www.calitp.org/assets/Cal-ITP.Benefits.PressRelease.220921.pdf) a demonstration of their Benefits App in September 2022 with Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST). The Benefits App is the first online tool to verify transit riders’ identity and benefit eligibility while linking fare discounts to debit and credit cards, in this case for older riders eligible for MST’s senior discounted fare. Today, MST riders eligible for this fare can verify their eligibility online and automatically enroll in the benefit with their credit or debit card. Riders then only need to tap the card linked to their enrollment to pay their fare and automatically receive their discounted rate. Cal-ITP agencies inform their customers about FDIC insured payments issuers that do not require minimum balances to help unbanked and underbanked riders obtain open-loop bank cards so they can access the Benefits App. 

The 2022 MST launch included Cal-ITP’s integration with [Login.gov](https://login.gov/), another software collaborative at the federal level, in the General Services Administration, that offers a centrally-provided single sign-on service tool to lower levels of government, as well as to federal agencies.

## Membership

“Membership” in Cal-ITP means purchasing and implementing the shared tools that the program provides to transit agencies via California’s Master Service Agreements (MSAs). To implement the Benefits App in particular, transit providers must first implement a contactless, open-loop payment system, options for which are available through the MSAs and MM. 

While the Benefits App was launched with MST, Cal-ITP has [plans to expand](https://www.calitp.org/assets/Cal-ITP.Benefits.PressRelease.220921.pdf) the app’s reach (i.e., its member base) among transit agencies both in and outside of California. As part of its effort to expand the number of agencies adopting the Benefits App, Cal-ITP also plans to build out verification processes for more benefits and discounts in the future, for example veterans, college discounts and benefits for riders with disabilities.

## Governance/Operations

Several California state and regional agencies along with the federal General Services agency partner with Cal-ITP to govern its work and the solutions it offers transit providers. Notable agency partners are California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA), California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), General Service Administration’s Technology Transformation Services (GSA’s TTS), The California Department of Technology (CDT), California Air Resources Board (CARB), and Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority. 

A [grant from the California Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program (TIRCP)](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/cal-itp-carb-market-sounding-final-020921-a11y.pdf) enabled CalSTA and Caltrans to support the formation and implementation of Cal-ITP as a separate operating team. 

To provide age-based verification for the Benefits App in particular, Cal-ITP partners with GSA’s TTS to integrate with Login.gov, another software collaborative. TTS owns and governs the front- and back-ends of Login.gov’s age-based verification process for Cal-ITP’s Benefits App. CDT independently built, maintains, and governs the [Identity Gateway](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a5mBnsxSfMI9hMh4ZxDZgGHQdbtuVIxs/view) which Cal-ITP uses to integrate with Login.gov and other identity providers to support eligibility verification. 

CARB has worked closely with Cal-ITP to release and manage joint market soundings.

Cal-ITP also maintains strong relationships across the private sector to shape program priorities and oversees a suite of consultants which are highly involved in day-to-day governance and operations, including software development and stakeholder management. Cal-ITP contracts with a primary vendor who is responsible for subcontracting to and managing all additional vendors. The prime uses its subcontractors to do the work necessary to boost Cal-ITP’s integration at the state government or local transit agency level. This allows the vendor to create new programs and transition to new data services piece by piece, while allowing agencies to continue using the services once the subcontractors leave. 


## Tech

The [Benefits App](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits) is a Django 4 web application that [talks to](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/deployment/infrastructure/) one or more Eligibility Verification API(s) through CDT’s [Identity Gateway](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a5mBnsxSfMI9hMh4ZxDZgGHQdbtuVIxs/view) to enable automated identity proofing and eligibility verification. Currently, this only includes Login.gov, though additional APIs will be added in the future as Cal-ITP expands the number and type of benefits the App supports.

The Benefits App does not require a user account and it does not store information about users; there is only minimal event tracking for problem analysis. Users can run the Benefits App locally with Docker and Docker Compose. For contactless payment acceptance, the App uses API requests to communicate with external payment vendors. The Benefits App is deployed to Microsoft Azure, and the network is managed by the California Department of Technology (CDT), which provides a firewall and distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection against attempts to disrupt a server’s standard traffic. 


## Market Landscape

At present, the market landscape for payment collection and benefit provision solutions for transit agencies is highly fragmented and populated by a number of vendors and bespoke solutions built almost exclusively for the large metropolitan agencies. See the [APTA transit footprint](https://footprint.apta.com/).

A 2021 joint [Market Sounding](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/cal-itp-carb-market-sounding-final-020921-a11y.pdf), conducted by Cal-ITP and CARB, highlights the fragmented nature of fare collection and benefits eligibility verification by transit agencies. Agencies provide and maintain one-off systems and processes for payments and eligibility verification. This is burdensome not only for agencies –– particularly small and rural transit agencies with limited resources to procure and maintain their own solutions –– but also for riders who use multiple transit systems and therefore need to create more than one transit account by physically appearing at the offices of multiple transit agencies and keep track of several closed-loop payment cards. 

According to Cal-ITP’s Program Manager, maintaining Cal-ITP as a separate operating body from the state’s Department of Transportation makes it easier for the state to establish deeper relationships within and across its vast network of statewide transit providers, as well as with transit providers outside the state. These relationships enable Cal-ITP to operate as a central support to help interested transit providers move away from the status quo of one-off, bespoke, and individually-contracted software solutions, and toward more cost-effective, standardized, state-developed and state-contracted solutions.
